# AI and Gemini Usage Policy

## Overview

Quick QR Maker is an open-source project that welcomes contributions from developers, including those who use AI-assisted coding tools like GitHub Copilot, Gemini, ChatGPT, and others.

## AI-Assisted Contributions

### Acceptable Use

We welcome AI-assisted contributions when:

- The contributor understands and can explain the code they're submitting
- The code is tested and verified to work correctly
- The code follows our style guidelines and best practices
- The contributor takes responsibility for the submitted code
- Proper attribution is given when using AI-generated code snippets

### Guidelines for AI Tools

When using AI tools like Gemini or other assistants:

1. **Review All Generated Code**: Never submit AI-generated code without reviewing and understanding it
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure all AI-generated code is properly tested
3. **Verify Security**: Check for security vulnerabilities in AI-generated code
4. **Maintain Quality**: Ensure code quality meets project standards
5. **Document Appropriately**: Add necessary comments and documentation
6. **Respect Licenses**: Ensure AI-generated code doesn't violate any licenses

### Disclosure
